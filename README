This primative version of the tvd code has only two fortran
files to compile and link.
The main routine is in io.f. The init routine reads from
standard in. An example input file is included.
The hydro variables are q1,q2, and q3, which are the mass density, the
momentum density and the total energy density. The code is Eulerian.
The TVD routine is basically a Godunov scheme that uses an eigenstate
method to get an approximate Riemann solution. The method is the one
devised by Harten, so the monotonicity constraint is achieved with a 
function defined in terms of a parameter epsilon.
